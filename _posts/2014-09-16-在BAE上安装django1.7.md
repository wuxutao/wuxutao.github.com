今天在BAE 3.0上部署django 1.7，遇到如下问题：

"The translation infrastructure cannot be initialized before the " django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: The translation infrastructure cannot be initialized before the apps registry is ready. Check that you don't make non-lazy gettext calls at import time.
This is after starting a new project. No additional apps are created or added.

解决办法如下：

修改index.py
        
       from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler
       from bae.core.wsgi import WSGIApplication

       application = WSGIApplication(WSGIHandle)

为    

       from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application

       application = WSGIApplication(get_wsgi_application())
